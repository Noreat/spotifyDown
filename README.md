# Changelog

### v1.5

# How?

It uses <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/">Spotify offical API</a> to fetch the tracks and Youtube(youtube-dl) to download the tracks.

P.S:- I have written a lot of Bad code, I will start improving the app and code soon.

## Tech Stack

    - React Native
    - Node Js (Backend Server) [Will make the backend code public soon]
    - Firebase (For Analytics

## Known Issues

    - Few playlist may give error unexpectedly.
    - If playlist name is too long, other components overlaps it
    - UI may break in low resolution devices(Tho I almost fixed that)
    - Downloads wrong tracks
    - If you encounter anything else, feel free to report an issue or DM me.

## Upcoming Features

    - In-app Music Player
