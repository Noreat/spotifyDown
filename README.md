An app that let's you download public Spotify playlists, illegally ofcourse XD 
<br>
It uses <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/">Spotify offical API</a> to fetch the tracks and Youtube(youtube-dl) to download the tracks. 


P.S:- I have written a lot of Bad code, I will start improving the app and code soon.
