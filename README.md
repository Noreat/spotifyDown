# How?

It uses <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/">Spotify offical API</a> to fetch the tracks and Youtube(youtube-dl) to download the tracks.

P.S:- ~~I have written a lot of Bad code, I will start improving the app and code soon.~~
I improved the code a little bit and the overall code structure. Will work on it soon.

# Tech Stack

- React Native
- Node Js (Backend Server) ~~[Will make the backend code public soon]~~
- Firebase (For Analytics)

# Known Issues

    - Few playlist may give error unexpectedly.
    - If playlist name is too long, other components overlaps it

    - Downloads wrong tracks
    - If you encounter anything else, feel free to report an issue or DM me.
