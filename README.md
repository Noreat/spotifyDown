# How it works?

It uses <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/">Spotify offical API</a> to fetch the tracks and Youtube(youtube-dl) to download the tracks.

P.S:- ~~I have written a lot of Bad code, I will start improving the app and code soon.~~
I improved the code a little bit and the overall code structure. Will work on it soon.

# Tech Stack

- React Native
- Node Js (Backend Server) ~~[Will make the backend code public soon]~~
- Firebase (For Analytics)

# Known Issues

- While a track(/s) is getting downloaded from a particular playlist, if user exists the screen or another playlist is loaded, then the download gets cancelled.
- Few playlist may give error unexpectedly.
- Due to youtube policies, few songs are not downloadable. This is because some videos are regionally restriced or so. [See these limitations](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core#limitations)
- Downloads wrong tracks
- If you encounter anything else, feel free to report an issue or DM me. I will definetly work on it.
